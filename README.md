Please read POCIv1d1, as this is the full 50+ page thesis paper on Proof Of Compute Integrity.

11-10-2025 is a semi-technical thesis. It was built and broadcasted live as the idea developed. I’ve since refined it into the current 50+ page version, but the 11-10-2025 document is still a more professional summary than the README.md.

A shorter less technical not as professional summary is on README.MD

The POCI_demo files are running, working scripts to test locally.
v1 — single model
v2 — mixed good and bad proofs
v3 — two models in comparison
v4 — single agent, 100 events with some bad proofs
v5 — two models, 100 events, one honest and one semi-honest
v6 — 1000 events, one honest and one semi-honest
To run; python must be installed. CMD, point CMD to wherever file is, type python poci_demov1.py , this will run the script if pointed correctly at the directory it was installed to/set. 

Diagram page contains diagrams, which will be turned into PNGs later.

Math is a short summary page of the mathematical approach.

Approaches covers the reasoning behind the angle we took and why.
